Note: This is a work in progress (WIP)
Think Siri but with your choice of voice!
This application will take your prompts and repond verbally through a variety of sound options

1. Record speech from microphone
2. Save recorded speech into a temp
3. Transcribe saved speech in temp
4. Pass transcribed speech to ChatGPT
5. Store ChatGPT response
6. Pass response to Cocqui-TTS for speech synthesis (Preferred would be Microsoft VALL-E if available for SOTA)
